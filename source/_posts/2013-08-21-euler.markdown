Project euler 
==============
Projecteuler.net is a collection of math problems that can be implementable in a programming flavor of your choosing.

In my github repo i've endevored to complete implementing these problems in any language I'm currently learning to better understand semantics of the language I'm working in and practice math skills.

Here is a helpful resource of answers to compare to   

https://code.google.com/p/projecteuler-solutions/wiki/ProjectEulerSolutions

make it a goal to get to these solutions, not to backwards solve.

Happy Solving!
