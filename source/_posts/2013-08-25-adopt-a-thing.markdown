Why
=========
One of my projects that I took interested in with CodeforAmerica is the adopt-a-hydrant project.
A solution introduced by CodeforBoston to solve unsafe frozen fire hydrants during the winter. 
Allowing citizens to be aware of important and streamlining the process is a reoccuring theme with this project.

I am trying to localize it for Norfolk and the http://www.norfolkbeautiful.org/ and Adopt-A-Spot Programs. Stream lining how this project takes place, encourages youth to get more active and showcase the efforts of volunteers. We can spatial recognize the hot zones where people are cleaning, and effeciently examine other areas of need.

Localization
=============

I had trouble with localization. After I got it set up, I was thinking how do I load my info into it. These four commits by @benschoenfeld to the c4hrva codeforamerica brigade repo helped me out.
