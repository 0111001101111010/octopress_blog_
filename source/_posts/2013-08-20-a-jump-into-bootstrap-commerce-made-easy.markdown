This is what I'm starting with. Its a small business website with infrequent needs.  http://thechinasun.com

Like all small restaurant businesses core information wanted by customers are

-Hours 	
-Phone Number 	
-Address 	
-Menu & Prices 	
-Gallery 	
	
Using Bootstrap is a smart decision for a finish looking website fast and good experience on mobile for menus and call numbers.
